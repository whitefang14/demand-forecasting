## Overview

Demand forecasting is crucial for businesses to anticipate customer demand, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In this repository, you will find code and documentation on various approaches to demand forecasting, ranging from classical time series models to modern machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of classical time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)
- Machine learning models for regression (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation utilities
- Ready-to-use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whitefang14/demand-forecasting.git
   cd demand-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
   - Requirements file (if available):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   - Or install major libraries manually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   # For deep learning models:
   pip install tensorflow keras
   ```

## Usage

- Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand and run demand forecasting experiments.
- To preprocess your own data, use the scripts in the `src/` directory.
- Example workflow:
  1. Place your data in the `data/` directory.
  2. Run preprocessing scripts to clean and format the data.
  3. Choose and configure a forecasting model in the notebook or script.
  4. Train, evaluate, and visualize the results.
