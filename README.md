## Overview

Demand forecasting is a critical component of supply chain and business planning. This repository provides notebooks and code for experimenting with different forecasting methods, including time series analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

## Features

- Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Examples of classic and advanced forecasting algorithms
- Visualizations of results and model performances
- Modular code to adapt for different datasets and applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Recommended Python packages (install as needed):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whitefang14/demand-forecasting.git
cd demand-forecasting
```

### Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or use JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
